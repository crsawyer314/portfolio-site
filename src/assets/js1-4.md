# Module 1 - Lesson 4
## HTML and CSS Basics, cont

### Learning Objectives:
* Add classes and IDs to website

### Introduction/Warm Up

For this warm-up, we're going to use an id to style a specific list item.

In your webpage, you should have a list, like the following:

~~~html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
~~~

Add an id to one element of your list by adding `id="list-item1"` inside the item's opening tag, like so:

~~~html
<li id="list-item1">Item 1</li>
~~~

Then, in your `style.css` file, add the following:

~~~css
#list-item1{
    color:blue;
    font-size:3em;
}
~~~

When you reload your page to display the changes you just made, you should see that your first list item (or whichever one you added the ID to) is now very large and blue, while none of the other elements are!

### Lesson

#### Advanced HTML

In the first part of this lesson, we will be learning a little more about HTML. We will be exploring the following tags and concepts:

* div
* span
* Inline vs block elements
* Em
* Strong
* ids/classes

All of the tags that we've introduced so far have been *semantic*, meaning that they pretty much are what the title says. We're now going to introduce `div`s and `span`s.

* div - Divider - This tag is a block-level divider tag. It doesn't make anything display on the screen explicitly, but rather it wraps a group of tags and then gets combined with *classes* and *IDs* to make CSS styling more effective. (We will be learning more about classes and IDs later in this lesson)

* span - In-line Divider - This tag acts similarly to a `div`, but instead of wrapping a group of tags, a span wraps a series of words so that specific styling can occur later. `span` is an in-line element, meaning that it won't start a new line, and it will take up only the width necessary. These are most often used inside of other tags, in conjunction with classes such as "italic-text" or "bold-text" or the like.

##### Block and In-line HTML Elements

A block element is an element that takes up the full width available, and which start on a new line. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>` and `<ol>` tags.

Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start new lines, and only take up as much space as necessary. We haven't introduced manyy of these to you yet, but you can think of these like adding a italic or bold styling to your text in a word processor; adding the style doesn't require a new line for the styled words. Examples include `<span>`, `<em>` and `<strong>` tags.

##### `em` and `strong`

In word processing, you can make your text bold or italic by simply highlighting and applying the appropriate style. In webpage creation, there are just a few extra steps that you need to follow. As mentioned above, you need to wrap your text in a `span` tag and then use CSS to style it. However, a few other options exist, and you need to consider where and when they should be used.

* em - Italic text - The `em` tag is short for "emphasis", and it italicizes your text. Importantly, a screen reader will pronounce the words in your `<em>` tags with an emphasis - so this tag isn't just about styling, it's also about accessibility.
* strong - Bold text - The `strong` tag is short for "strong", or in other words it says htat the text inside is of strong importance, and it bolds your text. Importantly, a screen reader will pronounce the words in your `<strong>` tags with an emphasis - so this tag isn't just about styling, it's also about accessibility.

You should be aware that `<b>` and `<i>` tagss exist, and will bold or italicize your text - but they are *not accessible* and should be avoided where possible.

##### IDs and Classes

Ids and classes are ways to select and specify paricular HTML elements for styling and interactivity. An element can only ever have one Id, and each Id must be unique (you can't have two different cat pictures with the Id "cat-picture"). On the other hand, an element can have as many classes as you want, and classes very often will be shared by multiple tags.

To add an Id, we add a space inside the opening tag, and add `id=""`, with a specific id inside the quotes. We did this in our warm-up activity. Some examples are below:

~~~html
<p id="par-1">This is a short paragraph.</p>

<ul id="myList">
    <li id="listItem1">Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>This paragraph is <span id="span-1">slightly longer</span> and has 
    some <strong id="str-1">bold</strong> and some <em id="em-1">italic</em> text.</p>
~~~

Note that in practice, you generally only add Ids to elements that you want to select as you actually need them. You don't need to add Ids to every element you create.

To add classes, the process is almost the same, but instead of `id=""`, you use `class=""`. Some examples are below:

~~~html
<p class="body-text">This is a short paragraph.</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li class="list-item">Item 1</li>
    <li class="list-item">Item 2</li>
    <li class="list-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>

<p class="body-text accessibility-text">This paragraph is slightly longer and 
    has some <strong>bold</strong> and some <em>italic</em> text.</p>
~~~

Note that while you can use any Id or class name that you want, you can't put spaces in the names. In the example of the last paragraph, with `class="body-text accessibility-text"`, there are actually two different classes; `body-text` and `accessibility-text`. It is convention (most common) to have your Id and class names all lower-case and words separated by a dash (-), but you can also do camel case (camelCase) or snake case (snake_case) if you would rather. Some characters aren't allowed in class and id names. If you want to know more about these rules, [this page is a helpful resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44748090/html-id-and-class-naming-best-practices).

We'll learn more about how to use classes and Ids below.

#### Advanced CSS

So far, the CSS that we've learned only allows us to select tag types, so every paragraph on our page, for example, would be styled the same. Now that we've added classes and Ids, however, our styling game can become much more interesting.

To style a specific element based on its Id, use the `#id` selector, and to style a (group of) element(s) based on class, use the `.class` selector. For example, with the following HTML, we can use the CSS below to apply specific styles to these elements:

HTML:

~~~html
<h1 id="title">My website</h1>

<p id="first-par" class="body-text">This is a short paragraph.</p>
<p class="body-text">Another short paragraph.</p>
<p class="body-text">And a final short paragraph.</p>
~~~

CSS:
~~~css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 2em;
}
.body-text {
    color: purple;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
#first-par {
    font-family:"Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: black;
}
#title {
    background-color: lightgrey;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration:underline;
}
~~~

As you can see, we've put a lot of properties with different selectors in our file. Hopefully, it's clear what each one does; if you're uncertain about any of them, go ahead and copy the HTML and the CSS into the respective files in your own website and see what changes!

CSS classes and Ids will come back in our next lessons, so don't forget about them. Remember:
* An HTML element can have as many classes as it wants, each separated by a space
* An HTML element can only have one Id
* All IDs must be unique
* An HTML element can have classes and an Id, or only one or the other

#### Assessment

Each lesson will be followed by a short assessment to help you know whether you have mastered the material. This is completely optional, but we encourage you to take the assessment as many times as necessary to get all questions correct - and understand where the answers are coming from.

MC - multiple choice
MA - multiple answer
SA - short answer


1. (MA) Which of the following are inline elements?
* a. div
* b. span
* c. em
* d. strong
* e. p
* f. h1
* g. ol

2. (MA) Which of the following are block elements?
* a. div
* b. span
* c. em
* d. strong
* e. p
* f. h1
* g. ol

~~~html
<body>
    <h1 id="header">Hello and Welcome!</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">This is a really short paragraph</p>
    <img class="body Text" src="./assets/img1.png" alt="a dummy image"/>
    <ol>
        <li>Text 1</li>
        <li class="list-items body">Text 2</li>
    </ol>
</body>
~~~
3. (MA) From the code above, which elements would be selected by the selector “.bodyText”?
* a. h1
* b. p
* c. img
* d. li #1 (Text 1)
* e. li #2 (Text 2)

##### Project Acceptance Criteria:
Continue your project from lesson 3 by adding the following elements to your web page:

* At least two paragraphs, each with different styles applied (two different colors, different fonts, alignments, font styles, etc - just that there should be at least two visibly different styles in yoru paragraphs). Remember, this will require a class or id to be applied to your paragraphs to select them individually
* Your page title has a unique ID
* Make sure each element in your page has at least one class or ID applied
* Add another image to your web page, and make each of the images a different size

##### Sample Project:

Enhance your tribute/profile web page with some fun styles. Add another image of the person you're highlighting, and make the different elements on the page visually appealing by applying different styles to different elements.
