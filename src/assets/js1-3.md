# Module 1 - Lesson 3
## HTML and CSS Basics

### Learning Objectives:
* Create a basic HTML + CSS website


### Introduction/Warm Up

Welcome to the first lesson where you will be writing code! We're going to get warmed up with some HTML, as you create your very first website ever. 

If you are using the online tools to code (like glitch or Codepen), you should be able to start a new project and immediately have 3 important files:

* index.html
* style.css
* script.js

If you are working locally (in VSCode), you will need to create these files now. They are/will be empty, and that is ok. 

In CodePen, some helpful code is done in the background, so you can skip the next bit. Otherwise, copy the following starter text into your `index.html` file:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
	<script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Now, in your starter file  where it says `Write code here`, or at the top of your html file in CodePen, type in the following and save your work:

~~~
<p>Hello World</p>
~~~

Congratulations, you have written your first piece of code! To see what it's doing:

* On CodePen: it should display automatically below your code
* On Glitch: you can either choose side-by-side viewing, or open your code in a new tab
* Locally (recommended): Go to your file explorer of choice, find your `index.html` file, right click and open the file in your web browser of choice (recommended: Chrome or Firefox)

You should see a white webpage with some black text that says Hello World. How cool was that?

### Basic HTML

What you did was write your first HTML. You may be wondering, "Why am I writing HTML? I thought this was a JavaScript course?" And you would be right - this is a JS course. However, one fo the main uses for JS is to make web pages interactive and interesting. In order to do that, we need a web page in the first place. Therefore, Lesson 3 (this one) and Lesson 4 (the next one) will walk you through the basics of HTML and CSS. You won't come out a master, but you'll know enough to make use of the JS that we'll teach you. 

Think if these languages in the following way:

* HTML: The beams and walls of a house. Nothing made with pure HTML will every look very pretty, but it's technically functional
* CSS: The paint and styling of a house. CSS makes things pretty
* JS: This makes things work. Now your doors and windows can open, the lights turn on and off, etc

In our warm-up, we gave you some starter code for HTML. Let's dive into what we have in this starter code.

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
	<script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

First, we declare that this is an HTML doctype. This line is good practice, but isn't technically necessary with modern web browsers. Essentially, this tells your browser that the file is HTML.

Next, we have our first "tag". HTML (HyperText Markdown Language) is composed of many tags. A tag, like the one you wrote in the warm up, is usually composed of an opening (`<p>`), then some filler, and then a closing (`</p>`). There are some exceptions, but we'll talk about those later.

The first tag in our code is `<html>`. At the end of the file is the matching `</html>` that closes it. Inside, we have the `<head>` and `<body>` sections. 

The `<head>` section generally controls meta-information about your web page, including:

* The website title displayed in the tab at the top of the browser
* Linked style sheets (including your `style.css` file)
* Other meta-information as necessary

The `<body>` section is where you will do most of your coding in creating a webpage. Whenever we tell you to add a piece of code, unless otherwise specified, this is where we want you to put it.

The very last thing in our `<body>` shoudl always be the `<script>` tag that links our JS file `script.js`.

#### HTML Tags to know

In our warm-up, you created a `<p>` tag. This is only one of many tag types that we want you to know. 

Try each of the following to see what they look like in your web page:

* head/body
* Headers (h1-h6)
* Paragraphs (p)
* Lists (ol/ul/li)
* Images (img)
* Breaks (br/hr)

Here's a bit more detail about each, as well as how to use them.

* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 - Header tags - There are 6 levels of headers. `h1` tags are the biggest and `h6` tags are the smallest. Accessibility tip: You should *never* use headers based solely on size/what they look like. Any styling necessary can be done in your style sheet later. Instead, think about how headers and other elements in your webpage will be interpreted/read by screen readers and with keyboard-only navigation, and use the different header levels to organize your web page accordingly.
* p - Paragraph tags - These are the typical tags used for including text in your web page. Accessibliity tip: It's possible to add line breaks inside of paragraph tags, but you should avoid this if you can. Each time you add a line break, you should close your tag and open a new one for more text.
* ol, ul, li - List tags - These are special tags, in that they have to be "nested", or have one type of tag inside another in order to work. The `ol` tag stands for "ordered list", or numbered list, the `ul` tag stands for "unordered list", or bulleted list, and `li` stands for list item. To create a list, you need to put `li` tags inside of an ordered or unordered list, as in the following examples:

~~~html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Bullet one</li>
    <li>Bullet two</li>
    <li>Bullet three</li>
</ul>
~~~

* img - Image tags - These are another special case in tags. Instead of opening and closing, these are a self-closing tag. You can either use a path to an image that you have stored on your computer, or a link to an image from the internet. Their use is as follows:

~~~html
<img src="path/to/image" alt="Some descriptive text about the image here in case it doesn't render or someone has a screen reader."/>
~~~

We recommend storing images locally on your machine, but if you are using CodePen or Glitch this isn't an option that is supported. To use a local image, download an image and put it inside a folder called "assets" inside your main project folder. So your file structure should look like this:

main folder
-assets
--image
-index.html
-style.css
-script.js

* br, hr - Break tags - The `br` tag stands for "break", and the `hr` tag stands for "horizontal break". They both add space to your web page, and are generally stylistic in nature. Try both to see how they interact with your other web page elements.

And that's all the HTML We're going to learn for now! That was a lot - make sure to try each of these elements in a web page. If you look at the project Acceptance Criteria for this lesson, you will get a good idea of where and how to use them effectively, or you can come up with your own idea.

#### Basic CSS

Next, we need to learn a bit of CSS, or styling. CSS is short for "Cascading Style Sheets". There is a *lot* that can be done with CSS, but we'll be learning just the very basics. You can learn more in other courses. For now, we'll be covering the following:

* (Font) Color
* Font size/styles
* Img sizing
* Alignment

First, we need to know how to set up our CSS. At the top of your `index.html` file, in the `head` tag, there is a `link` tag that has `style.css` in it. This tells your web page to apply all of the styles from your `style.css` file to your web page. So let's had over there and start styling!

In your `style.css` file, add the following code (copy/paste is fine!):

~~~css
p {
    color: red;
}
~~~

Now go look at your web page. What has happened? All of your paragraphs (`p` tags) have turned red! Let's break it down.

There are three main parts to your CSS commands:

1. The selector - Here, the selector was `p`. This told your CSS to apply the style to ALL of the `p` tags in our HTML.
2. Curly braces (`{}`) - These hold all of the styles we're applying to the thing we selected. In this case, we're only holding one style, the color change, but we could also put thigns like a font size change, a font change, a center positioning, and so many more - and all of it would be held by the curly braces.
3. The style! - Here, we changed the `color` (the font color) to red. To apply a style, you need to put down what you're changing (we'll talk about more style options below), then a colon (`:`), then what you want the style to be, and lastly a semicolon (`;`).

Here's some more information about each of our specific CSS styles we mentioned above. Try using each of them, applied to different elements in the page!:

* color - This changes the font color of whatever it's applied to. You can use some colors by writing our their names, like we did above, such as red, orange, cyan, green, etc. You can also write the hex code of a specific color if you want more options and control.
* font-size , font-family - Font size/styles - The font-size style controls the size of your element's font. You can use this to change how big or small your headers are, as well as how your paragraphs and etc look. You can use a few different metrics, including px and em. See [this page on font styling](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_font_style.asp) for more information. The font-family style is one of the trickiest to remember. It change sthe font of your text. However, not every browser or computer supports every font, so you can never give just one option. You always need ot give a list, starting with the font you want most/first, and going down to the most basic option. An example is given below:

~~~css
h1 {
    color: green;
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 4em;
}
~~~

* height, width - Img sizing - These control the size of an image that you include. Only apply them to `img` tags. Again, you can use px or em for the sizing.
* text-align - Alignment - This controls where on the screen your element will show up. In the next lesson we're going to cover a bit more about how to select specific elements and give you more granular control, but for now this will let you center, right-align, left-align, or justify elements.

And there we have it! Your basic intro to HTML and CSS!

#### Assessment

Each lesson will be followed by a short assessment to help you know whether you have mastered the material. This is completely optional, but we encourage you to take the assessment as many times as necessary to get all questions correct - and understand where the answers are coming from.

MC - multiple choice
MA - multiple answer
SA - short answer


1. (MC) What is the correct tag type for the title of a website?

* a. h1
* b. h2
* c. p
* d. title
* e. head

2. (MC) Where (inside of which tag) do you change the text that shows up in the tab for your web browser?

* a. h1
* b. h2
* c. p
* d. title
* e. head

3. (SA) Type “hex color picker” into the search browser of your choice (google will give you an applet, others might require you to use a website), and if necessary go to the first resulting website to get a color picking tool. Find the hex code of your favorite color, and submit it below. Note that the format you submit matters; you must submit a value that starts with ‘#’ and has no spaces.

* a. submit a value here:

##### Project Acceptance Criteria:
Create a basic web page with at least the following elements:
* A page title (h1) that is a different color than black
* At least two paragraphs (p)
* At least one list (ul or ol)
* At least one image (img), resized to be easily viewable
* Your website title in the tab at the top of the browser should match your h1 page title.

##### Sample Project:

Create a basic profile page about yourself, a family member, a pet, or a famous person that you admire. Include all required website elements, focusing on the theme of the person of pet you're highlighting.
