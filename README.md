# Catherine Sawyer's personal portfolio page

This is an updated version of my portfolio site, which was initially created in React 16.

Style based on Editorial by HTML5 UP, used under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

This website (and its content) is free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license, as I believe that open-sourcing code makes the world a better and freer place.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
